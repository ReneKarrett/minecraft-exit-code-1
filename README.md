Minecraft is a fun game, but sometimes it can stop working. One problem that many players see is the "exit code 1" error. This makes the game crash. It can happen for a few different reasons, like old graphics drivers, mods that don't work right, or issues with Java. But don't worry, there are ways to fix the Minecraft exit code 1 error on Windows.

In order to fix the error you need to study the detailed instructions 🔥🔥 click “Download” to get started and follow the step by step instructions to fix the error 👀👉

Update Graphics Drivers
First, check if your graphics drivers are old. Old drivers can cause problems and errors like exit code 1. To update them:

Open the Run box (press Win+R)
Type "dxdiag" and press Enter
Go to the Display tab to see your driver version
If there's a new version, download it from Nvidia, AMD, or Intel
Change Minecraft Launcher Path
If your Windows username has special symbols like ! or *, it can cause the exit code 1 error. To fix it:

Make a shortcut for the Minecraft Launcher
Right-click the shortcut and open Properties
In the Target box, add "-workDir %ProgramData%.minecraft" to the end
Click OK and start Minecraft
If that doesn't work, make a new Windows account without special symbols.

Fix Java Path
Sometimes, Minecraft's path to Java can be wrong, causing exit code 1. To fix it:

Open the Minecraft Launcher and go to Launch Options
Turn on the Java executable option
If the path ends with "javaw.exe", change it to "java.exe"
Save and restart the game
Remove Bad Mods
Mods can make Minecraft more fun, but they can also cause problems after game updates. To find a bad mod:

Open the Run box and type "%AppData%"
Go to the ".minecraft" folder, then "logs"
Open the "latest.log" file and look for mod errors
Remove the mod with error and see if it fixes exit code 1
 
Minecraft is still one of the most popular games on the planet, but it's far from perfect. Sometimes the game will crash with the "Exit Code 1" error, leaving it in an unplayable state. Fortunately, it's a common issue, and we will show you how to fix it in no time.

Use the Correct Mod Version
One of the main reasons you're running into the Exit Code 1 error on Minecraft is because your mod version doesn't match the Minecraft version installed on your computer. All of the mods you're using should be the same as the version of Minecraft you're using.

For example, if you have Minecraft version 1.20.6 installed on your computer and you have a mod made for version 1.19.4, you might see the error. In this case, you'll need to manually update the outdated mod to its latest version.

To do this, you'll first need to check the Minecraft version installed on your computer. Open Minecraft, click the "Installations" tab, and check the "Latest Release" entry to see your Minecraft version.

Next, open the Run dialogue box by pressing the Windows+R shortcut key, type %appdata% in the search field, and click "OK."

In the Roaming folder that opens up, navigate to .Minecraft > Mods.

In the mods folder, go through the names of all the mods and check the version number. If you find a mod with a different version number than the Minecraft version installed on your computer, it's probably the culprit behind the error.

You'll need to replace that mod with its latest version to fix the problem. For this, take note of the name of that mod, and then visit the CurseForge website. Type the name of that mod and hit the search icon.

Choose the relevant mod from the result that appears. Switch to the "Files" tab. You'll see different versions of that mod. You need to click on that version which corresponds with the version of Minecraft you're using.
